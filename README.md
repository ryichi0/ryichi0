#my profile

# Hi, I'm Ghazal 👋
I’m an aspiring Front-End Developer with a solid foundation in HTML and CSS at an intermediate level. I also have basic knowledge of Bootstrap, which I’m continuing to build on. My journey into the world of programming began with Python, which sparked my interest in problem-solving and logical thinking.

Currently, I’m focused on two key areas: deepening my understanding of HTML and CSS to create well-structured and responsive layouts, and learning JavaScript to bring interactivity and dynamic functionality to my web projects. I’m committed to continuously improving my skills and growing as a developer.
